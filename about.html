        <h3>What is GukStruck?</h3>
        <p>GukStruck is a therapy program located at ██████████, in the Congo Jungle. We (as in Guk) use a variety of methods to help our patients such as; Meditation, Waterboarding, poking them with a very long slightly sharp stick, and other groundbreaking mental health tactics. Patients are flown into Africa by plane, and when they arrive at the therapy office, are personally greeted by Guk (HUGE DEAL). Patients then make a plan about how long their therapy will last, and what they are coming for. They can stay at a five star local hotel, with NO ROACHES and ONLY SOME RATS. </p>

        <h3>Who Really is Guk?</h3>
        <p>You have had a brief description of Guk already, but much has been left in mystery and legend. From famous cryptid hunter to therapist, how did he do this? We have gathered experts in every field to determine who or what Guk really is, and we've come to determine some things about him. Ancient cave drawings show of a being shorter than most, but containing great power. Not only that, but many artistic depictions of him have been created right under our noses. Using a 7 billion dollar supercomputer, we have generated the various beings that could be Guk, which will be showcased below. This is important, as Guk changes forms frequently, we think, or the scientists could just be lazy.</p>
