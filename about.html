        <h3>What is GukStruck?</h3>
        <p>GukStruck is a therapy program located at ██████████, in the Congo Jungle. We (as in Guk) use a variety of methods to help our patients such as; Meditation, Waterboarding, poking them with a very long slightly sharp stick, and other groundbreaking mental health tactics. Patients are flown into Africa by plane, and when they arrive at the therapy office, are personally greeted by Guk (HUGE DEAL). Patients then make a plan about how long their therapy will last, and what they are coming for. They can stay at a five star local hotel, with NO ROACHES and ONLY SOME RATS. </p>

        <h3>Who Really is Guk?</h3>
        <p>You have heard a basic description of Guk. A mysterious being, who has went from Bigfoot hunting to therapy. Well now you can see him (woah). That's right. Nobody has ever gotten a picture of Guk, and most who see him describe him as a different thing than the other person. But now, in the year of 2022, we have discovered something huge. An AI program that lets us think what Guk is thinking, and Guk owns a mirror. We have used this to see what Guk sees and as a result, these are the different beings that make up Guk.</p>
